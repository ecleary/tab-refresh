# Tab Refresh Press Release

## Heading ##

Make each new browser tab a pleasant experience.

## Sub-heading ##

For anyone who uses a web browser, turn the expanse of a newly opened browser tab into a window of refreshing calm and convenience.

For anyone who uses a web browser, instead of just opening a new tab, open a window into refreshing calm and convenience.

## Summary ##

One of the most common actions that many users perform with a web browser is opening new tabs. With Tab Refresh, users have the opportunity to experience a refreshing sight and to easilly access useful features, like a clock and a calendar, every time they open a new tab. Tab Refresh makes the user's day better by adding delight and convenience to an existing workflow, without adding the overhead of an additional app that the user needs to manage. And when users need to focus on a single app or screen, instead of minimizing windows, simply opening a new tab will provide the serenity to focus.

## Problem ##

Tab Refresh solves two problems:

1. New browser tabs occupy a lot of screen space without providing much value.
2. Our modern computing experience provides a vast amount of utility with little opportunity for tranquility and restoration.

## Solution ##

Tab Refresh solves both problems by turning the vast expanse of a new browser tab into both a calming sight and an unobtrusive but convenient place to access handy features.
